# Pixel-To-do-List
A retro-style to-do list built with HTML, CSS, and JS. Features pixel-art buttons, checkbox icons, and smooth click animations. Inspired by old-school game interfaces — simple, scrollable, and fun to use.  — @kali.kodes

This is a simple to-do list app I designed with a retro pixel-art style. Everything from the buttons to the checkboxes was styled to feel like an old-school game interface similar to Minecraft.

It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes:
- Custom pixel buttons with click animations
- Checkbox and delete icons made with pixel art
- Scrollable task list that fits inside a pixel “screen”
- Clean, responsive layout that still keeps the retro vibe

How to Use
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Type a task into the pixel input field
4. Press "Enter Task" to stage it
5. Click "Add" to lock it into your list

I made it just for fun and practice — it’s a mix of nostalgia and functionality.
